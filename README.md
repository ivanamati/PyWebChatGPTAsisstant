# PyWebAsisstant

This is my starting project for learning Flask to develop web applications.
PyWebAsisstant has a script for answering the users question.
It searches the Wikipedia and Wolframalpha.

All the user has to do is write the question in the space provided for it and wait for the answer of the digital assistant.

To use this web page do the following:

How to run this app:

- open the root folder of the app:
   ```shell
   cd absolute_path_to_root_folder
   ```

- install requirements:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

- run the app:
    ```shell
    python3 app.py
    ```

Afterwords you recieve a development HTTP link in the terminal. 

Copy it, add /start at the end of the HTTP and paste it in your browser.

Enjoy
