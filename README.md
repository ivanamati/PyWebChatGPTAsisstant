# PyWebChatGPTAsisstant

This is my project from Flask learning in which i included OpenAI API 
to learn how to work with chatgpt.

PyWebChatGPTAsisstant runs with openai API key, which is here hidden. 

All the user has to do is write the question in the space provided for it and wait for the answer of chatgpt.

To use this web page do the following:

How to run this app:

- open the root folder of the app:
   ```shell
   cd absolute_path_to_root_folder
   ```

- install requirements:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

- run the app:
    ```shell
    python3 app.py
    ```

Afterwords you recieve a development HTTP link in the terminal. 

Copy it, add /start at the end of the HTTP and paste it in your browser.

Enjoy
